SnakeLab exposes three ZeroMQ interfaces for downstream systems. Install
`pyzmq` for Python clients and replace `wintermute` with your server hostname.

| Interface | Default endpoint | Client socket | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Control | `tcp://wintermute:41970` | `REQ` | [Control protocol](/pages/control-protocol.html) |
| Events | `tcp://wintermute:41972` | `SUB` | [Event protocol](/pages/event-protocol.html) |
| Telemetry | `tcp://wintermute:41971` | `SUB` | [Live telemetry](#live-telemetry) |

1. Establish an event subscription before submitting work.
2. Call `simulation.submit` on the control port with a configuration object.
3. Save the returned `run_id`; the reply confirms the run is queued.
4. React to `simulation_ended` events whose `payload.run_id` matches that run.

The event is an asynchronous completion result. Delivery is best effort, with
no acknowledgement or replay; use `simulation.status` to reconcile missed
notifications while the run is known to the server. Every submission creates
a new run, including retries after a timeout.

Control and telemetry use protocol version 1. Events use their independently
versioned protocol, currently version 2.

## Live Telemetry

Live telemetry is published on `tcp://wintermute:41971`. Connect a ZeroMQ `SUB`
socket and subscribe to one or more topics:

- `snake_lab.run`
- `snake_lab.episode`
- `snake_lab.frame`

Per-move frames are built and published only while a subscription matches
`snake_lab.frame`. Opening `lab-client` during a run enables streaming on
subsequent moves; closing the last viewer disables it once ZeroMQ reports the
disconnection. Prefix subscriptions such as `snake_lab.` and the empty filter
(all topics) also enable frames. Subscribing only to run, episode, or completion
events does not enable them. Subscription and disconnect detection are
asynchronous; joining a paused run provides a fresh frame on its next move.
Run/episode telemetry, stored results, and completion events continue independently.
No client change or simulation configuration option is required.

Each publication is a two-part message: the UTF-8 topic followed by a JSON
envelope containing `protocol_version`, `sequence`, `run_id`, and `payload`.
Subscribe before submitting a run when the initial lifecycle events are needed.

The project's
[control client](https://github.com/NadimGhaznavi/snake-lab/blob/main/snake_lab/control_client.py)
and
[telemetry client](https://github.com/NadimGhaznavi/snake-lab/blob/main/snake_lab/telemetry_zmq.py)
are the reference implementations.

## High-score Board Snapshots

Every successfully completed simulation saves one board: the first position
where it achieved its final high score. Each episode retains its highest-scoring
immutable board by reference, then replaces the simulation's best board only
if its completed score is higher. Ties keep the earlier board. A simulation
that never scores saves the first completed episode's starting board.

Capture works without a viewer or telemetry subscription. There are no board
copies or database writes in the capture hot loop. The server saves the winning
snapshot with the final score and completed status before publishing
`simulation_ended`. Failed and cancelled simulations do not save snapshots.

Request a saved board on the control endpoint using a `REQ` socket:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "request_id": "snapshot-1",
  "method": "simulation.highscore_snapshot",
  "payload": {"run_id": "<run ID>"}
}
```

The successful response has `status: "ok"` and a payload containing `run_id`
and `snapshot`. The snapshot fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Snapshot format version, currently 1; separate from the control protocol version |
| `episode` | Episode number, starting at 1 |
| `step` | Move number within the episode; 0 for a starting-board capture |
| `board.grid_size` | `[width, height]` |
| `board.snake_head` | Head coordinate `[x, y]` |
| `board.snake_body` | Coordinates ordered from neck to tail, excluding the head |
| `board.food` | Food coordinate, or `null` when the board is full |
| `board.direction` | Direction vector `[dx, dy]` |
| `board.score` | The simulation's final high score |

Coordinates are zero-based, with x increasing rightward and y downward.
The board object can be passed directly to `BoardSnapshot.from_dict()`.
Clients own rendering and image export; the server returns raw JSON, not SVG
or PNG. See the [control protocol](/pages/control-protocol.html#high-score-board-snapshots)
for an example response payload.

Python clients using the project's `AsyncLabClient` can request the full
response envelope with:

```python
response = await client.highscore_snapshot(run_id)
if response["status"] == "ok":
    snapshot = response["payload"]["snapshot"]
    board = snapshot["board"]
    # Render or export the board in your client.
else:
    code = response["error"]["code"]
    # Handle unavailable snapshots separately from unknown run IDs.
```

Lookup reads the database, so saved snapshots remain accessible after server
restarts. Existing runs retain their scores and configurations but have no
snapshot if they completed before capture was implemented. The server does
not replay simulations or reconstruct missing boards.

| Error code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run_not_found` | The run ID does not exist in the database |
| `snapshot_unavailable` | The run exists but has no saved snapshot, including old, unfinished, failed, or cancelled runs |
| `invalid_request` | The payload must contain only a non-empty string `run_id` |

Existing clients can continue using the control and event protocols without
requesting snapshots. An optimizer such as AX3L can request a snapshot using
the run ID it selects as its golden configuration; SnakeLab does not select
the golden configuration itself.

## Simulation Execution

Game logic, policy inference, replay storage, and training run on CPU. The
simulator uses the original Python game rules, Python exploration generator,
and NumPy replay batches. Episodes remain serial with one training attempt
after each completed episode when a batch is available. CUDA availability does
not change the selected device.

This restores the execution path used before 0.10.2, with inference and
training now forced to CPU. Seeded trajectories differ from the tensor-based
0.10.2 release; identical results across hardware or library versions are not
guaranteed. Subscription-driven telemetry and completion event semantics are
unchanged.

## Replay and Training

Replay stores complete episodes and samples fixed-length sliding windows
uniformly across all eligible windows, without replacement within a batch.
Windows never cross episode boundaries. Longer games contribute more windows;
a batch can contain multiple windows from the same game.

The defaults are `training.batch_size: 64` (windows) and
`training.sequence_length: 8` (moves). Training starts when enough windows
exist for a batch; there is no minimum episode count. Each sampled window
contributes its final move as the loss target. Terminal moves are included
when their ending windows are selected.

The whole-game sampling and terminal-aligned chunking introduced in 0.10.4
have been rolled back. Remove `training.replay_min_episodes` from saved
configurations created with that feature. Explicit `batch_size` values remain
supported and now count windows again; use 64 to match the restored default.

## Configuration Queries

The `configurations` table stores one row per accepted run, linked to
`simulation_runs.run_id`. Its 26 numeric columns follow the configuration
schema, replacing dots with underscores: `training.learning_rate` becomes
`training_learning_rate`, and `game.rewards.food` becomes `game_rewards_food`.
`seed` uses `BIGINT UNSIGNED`; other integers use `INT UNSIGNED` and numbers
use `DOUBLE`. Configuration and run creation commit together. Configuration values are stored only in `configurations`.

Repeated configurations have separate rows for each run. Join to run status
when searching completed experiments:

```sql
SELECT c.training_learning_rate, c.model_hidden_size,
       COUNT(*) AS completed_runs, MAX(r.high_score) AS best_score
FROM configurations AS c
JOIN simulation_runs AS r ON r.run_id = c.run_id
WHERE r.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.training_learning_rate, c.model_hidden_size;
```

See the changelog for the one-time v0.13.0 clean database setup.

Schema `snake_lab/schemas/database-v3.sql` only creates the new table. It can
be reapplied safely and does not backfill historical runs or delete data.
New accepted runs receive configuration rows immediately, regardless of their
eventual status. Deleting a run cascades to its configuration row.

Schema `snake_lab/schemas/database-v4.sql` adds nullable JSON column
`simulation_runs.high_score_snapshot` for one saved board per run. It can be
reapplied safely without deleting existing data or backfilling old snapshots.
NULL means no snapshot is available. See [High-score Board Snapshots](#high-score-board-snapshots)
for capture behavior and the retrieval API.

`scripts/upgrade.sh` applies the migration while the service is stopped,
before deploying and starting the application. To apply the schema separately:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop snake-lab.service
sudo scripts/apply-database-schema.sh
# Restart after the schema command succeeds.
sudo systemctl start snake-lab.service
```

To run the optional MariaDB integration test, set `SNAKELAB_TEST_DB_SOCKET` to
an isolated test server's Unix socket. The test uses passwordless root access
and creates and drops a randomly named test database.
